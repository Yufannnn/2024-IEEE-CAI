							"abstract": "The efficacy of reinforcement learning has been substantiated in the development of intelligent modules for achieving autonomous collision avoidance in maritime autonomous surface ships (MASS). However, the performance of reinforcement learning algorithms with different configurations varies for making decisions. The evaluation and comparison of different configurations of reinforcement learning algorithms in this application remain challenging due to the absence of standardized or consensually adopted testing methodologies. In light of this, we proposed a simulation-based evaluation framework with three hierarchical metrics, namely, collision-free achievement, deviation angle for path-following, and avoidance time consumed, to enable the evaluation of reinforcement learning-based collision avoidance approaches. Comparative experimental analyses were conducted on six configurations of reinforcement learning algorithms with distinct reward designs across three typical vessel encounter scenarios in a simulated environment. Results indicated that by employing a potential-based design in intermediate rewards, specifically through the calculation of the course deviation, a notable enhancement in path-following can be achieved. Additionally, the weighted sum approach in the final reward design has also been demonstrated to effectively enhance the respective performance.

							"abstract": "With the advancement of big data, the scope and potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) have acquired major momentum. Data-Centric Artificial Intelligence (DCAI) is one of the most emergent fields of study in the current era of digitalization. Many examples have proven the effectiveness of Machine- and Deep Learning methods. In industrial production, however, limitations are still present that hinder application online and in a series that goes beyond isolated use cases. One crucial issue is data precondition, i.e., data quality, consistency, and labeling. As DCAI addresses these issues, developments in this field have caught the attention of various experts. In summary, DCAI continues to be an exciting and promising field of study that enhances AI applicability. Several research works have been conducted in DCAI, but unfortunately, no comprehensive reviews have been conducted to summarize and highlight the results. This gap in knowledge inspired our work, that aims to answer well-structured research questions. The focus of this paper is to clarify the terminology used in DCAI while also distinguishing it from other AI-related problems. This helps to analyze the current standards and problems associated with DCAI. This paper summarizes current use cases of DCAI and their impact on industries.

Data-Centric Artificial Intelligence (DCAI) is one of the most emergent fields of study in the current era of digitalization. Many examples have proven the effectiveness of Machine- and Deep Learning methods. In industrial production, however, limitations are still present that hinder application online and in a series that goes beyond isolated use cases. One crucial issue is data precondition, i.e., data quality, consistency, and labeling. As DCAI addresses these issues, developments in this field have caught the attention of various experts. In summary, DCAI continues to be an exciting and promising field of study that enhances AI applicability. Several research works have been conducted in DCAI, but unfortunately, no comprehensive reviews have been conducted to summarize and highlight the results. This gap in knowledge inspired our work, that aims to answer well-structured research questions. The focus of this paper is to clarify the terminology used in DCAI while also distinguishing it from other AI-related problems. This helps to analyze the current standards and problems associated with DCAI. This paper summarizes current use cases of DCAI and their impact on industries. Through this detailed description, readers can understand the potential and benefits of using DCAI in different business sectors. The analysis of the latest methods employed by DCAI to achieve enhanced AI performance and outcomes provides valuable insights for professionals and organizations that strive to incorporate AI into their business.",

							"abstract": "Recent developments in artificial intelligence have been giving rise to new job profiles comprising several tasks which require different technical and cognitive skills. These tasks, most of which are new to human resources staff and job seekers, make it difficult to assess the complexity of a job and therefore challenging to select the right candidate profile. In this paper, we present an automated classification scheme based on Bloom's taxonomy, a hierarchical model of educational objectives, which is applied on online AI-related job postings. The main goals are an improvement of the prediction accuracy of the classification model as well as an analysis of requirements for AI-related jobs. The modeling relies on a pre-trained BERT model which is fine-tuned on our dataset. In a two-step process, a semi-supervised approach is used in order to benefit from a large amount of unlabeled data. The model-generated pseudo-labels have been evaluated by the experts. Taking advantage of the now available larger correctly labeled dataset, a fully supervised training is done on the enhanced dataset and compared to the semi-supervised approach. Our results show that both models can classify AI-related tasks with good performance, supporting the use of semi-supervised training. The performance limitation rather lies in the subjectivity of expert labeling which is addressed in more detail in the paper. Moreover, we observe the model being more accurate at classifying tasks at higher levels of Bloom's taxonomy than at lower levels.",

The augmented image pairs make the change detector easier to learn the optimal parameters and improve the final detection performance.

In this paper, we propose ADAAUG, a new reinforcement learning framework that adaptively augments the change image pairs. An actor selects the best augmentation operation from the operation set according to the image pair. The augmented image pairs make the change detector easier to learn the optimal parameters and improve the final detection performance.

							"abstract": "Turbine engine monitoring is an essential enabler for predictive maintenance strategies. Among popular monitoring techniques, estimating performance indicators is a long-standing subject from which a variety of methods have been proposed\u2014including recent applications of machine learning. Traditionally, indicators estimation is viewed under the single-point perspective: at one fixed operating condition, mapping observed measurement data to indicator values. In this perspective, while state-of-the-art methods have promising results in some favorable testing scenarios, none of them have completely resolved underterminined cases in which the number of indicators to-be-estimated is larger than the number of observed measurements. In this work, we study a use case in monitoring aircraft engines that falls into an under-determined setting. In order to mitigate this, we adapt a multi-point perspective that leverages measurements at multiple pre-determined steady-state operating conditions. It is noteworthy that we relax the condition-independence hypotheses made by previous multi-point models to better align with real scenarios. Unlike previous works under the multi-point perspective, we focus on machine learning methods as resolutions; in particular, we conduct a series of experiments with artificial neural networks in the considered use case. Our first contribution is to demonstrate that the estimation precision provided by tested models is significantly improved in the multi-point perspective in comparison with the single-point case. Our first contribution is to relax the constraints imposed by previously proposed multi-point models: we aim to estimate the scalar coefficients of performance indicators and assume a generic model on the dependency of these coefficients on operating conditions. This change of perspective well adapts to the use case in consideration and allows a higher-dimensional exploitable data. Secondly, we explore a scenario involving temporal data (i.e., data from consecutive flight missions) and show that neural networks with appropriate architectures can well exploit such \"multi-time\" data structure.",

Our first contribution is to demonstrate that the estimation precision provided by tested models is significantly improved in the multi-point perspective in comparison with the single-point case. Our first contribution is to relax the constraints imposed by previously proposed multi-point models: we aim to estimate the scalar coefficients of performance indicators and assume a generic model on the dependency of these coefficients on operating conditions. This change of perspective well adapts to the use case in consideration and allows a higher-dimensional exploitable data. Secondly, we explore a scenario involving temporal data (i.e., data from consecutive flight missions) and show that neural networks with appropriate architectures can well exploit such \"multi-time\" data structure.",

What is more, we found that although most traditional big IT companies have not clearly stated the usage of AI in marine pollution, the need to diminish the impacts of nuclear pollution in oceans will inevitably urge new applications of AI in oceanic nuclear contamination.",

							"abstract": "Differential drive robots (DDRs) belong to a unique category of mobile robots that regulate their speed and direction by independently adjusting the speeds of two wheels. Due to their high maneuverability, DDRs can execute various missions requiring precise positioning and navigation. To guide DDRs in target tracking, the Approximate Pose Increment Control (APIC) is applied to provide reference direction and speed control based on the Line of Sight (LOS) guidance principle. However, the ordinary APIC is unable to consider the physical constraints on the DDRs, potentially resulting in poor tracking performance when the target is near the DDR. One of the most common failure scenarios is the \"deadlock loop\", which prevents DDRs from reaching the target and causes them to keep circling near it due to a too-large turning radius. To address this issue, the Reinforcement Learning (RL) based APIC is proposed, allowing the system to learn optimal actions from the environment to reach the goal.

Due to their high maneuverability, DDRs can execute various missions requiring precise positioning and navigation. To guide DDRs in target tracking, the Approximate Pose Increment Control (APIC) is applied to provide reference direction and speed control based on the Line of Sight (LOS) guidance principle. However, the ordinary APIC is unable to consider the physical constraints on the DDRs, potentially resulting in poor tracking performance when the target is near the DDR. One of the most common failure scenarios is the \"deadlock loop\", which prevents DDRs from reaching the target and causes them to keep circling near it due to a too-large turning radius. To address this issue, the Reinforcement Learning (RL) based APIC is proposed, allowing the system to learn optimal actions from the environment to reach the goal. In this approach, a Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) agent is trained to dynamically adjust two gain values in APIC based on real-time observations. The proposed method not only enhances the targeting performance of APIC but also provides an expert guidance law for imitation learning.",

							"abstract": "Machine learning models often struggle to generalise to out-of-distribution (OOD) data. One promising solution for solving this problem is test-time training domain adaptation, which adjusts a trained model to the new test data without revisiting the source dataset, thus preserving the privacy of source data. However, existing test-time training methods have not considered the mining of category information of the test data in the training for domain adaptation, thus suffering in inaccurate domain alignment. In this paper, we propose a novel method called category-aware test-time training (CAT3) to adapt the pre-trained model to test data on the fly. CAT3 first trains a model with multiple diverse classifiers using the source datasets and conducts a source data summarisation. Then, it assigns the pseudo-labels for the test data that have consistent classification results from the trained classifiers and adjusts the pre-trained model by aligning these reliable test data to their corresponding source data categories iteratively.

One promising solution for solving this problem is test-time training domain adaptation, which adjusts a trained model to the new test data without revisiting the source dataset, thus preserving the privacy of source data. However, existing test-time training methods have not considered the mining of category information of the test data in the training for domain adaptation, thus suffering in inaccurate domain alignment. In this paper, we propose a novel method called category-aware test-time training (CAT3) to adapt the pre-trained model to test data on the fly. CAT3 first trains a model with multiple diverse classifiers using the source datasets and conducts a source data summarisation. Then, it assigns the pseudo-labels for the test data that have consistent classification results from the trained classifiers and adjusts the pre-trained model by aligning these reliable test data to their corresponding source data categories iteratively. Unlike existing test-time training methods, CAT3 reveals the category information of the test data and aligns these reliable test data to the source data at the category level instead of the dataset level. Empirical results demonstrate that CAT3 can outperform the current state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks, indicating our proposed method's effectiveness.",

							"abstract": "With the rapid surge in the prevalence of Large Language Models (LLMs), individuals are increasingly turning to conversational AI for initial insights across various domains, including health-related inquiries such as disease diagnosis. Many users seek potential causes on platforms like ChatGPT or Bard before consulting a medical professional for their ailment. These platforms offer valuable benefits by streamlining the diagnosis process, alleviating the significant workload of healthcare practitioners, and saving users both time and money by avoiding unnecessary doctor visits. However, Despite the convenience of such platforms, sharing personal medical data online poses risks, including the presence of malicious platforms or potential eavesdropping by attackers. To address privacy concerns, we propose a novel framework combining FHE and Deep Learning for a secure and private diagnosis system. Operating on a question-and-answer-based model akin to an interaction with a medical practitioner, this end-to-end secure system employs Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) to handle encrypted input data. Given FHE's computational constraints, we adapt deep neural networks and activation functions to the encryted domain.

Many users seek potential causes on platforms like ChatGPT or Bard before consulting a medical professional for their ailment. These platforms offer valuable benefits by streamlining the diagnosis process, alleviating the significant workload of healthcare practitioners, and saving users both time and money by avoiding unnecessary doctor visits. However, Despite the convenience of such platforms, sharing personal medical data online poses risks, including the presence of malicious platforms or potential eavesdropping by attackers. To address privacy concerns, we propose a novel framework combining FHE and Deep Learning for a secure and private diagnosis system. Operating on a question-and-answer-based model akin to an interaction with a medical practitioner, this end-to-end secure system employs Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) to handle encrypted input data. Given FHE's computational constraints, we adapt deep neural networks and activation functions to the encryted domain. Further, we also propose a faster algorithm to compute summation of ciphertext elements. Through rigorous experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. The proposed framework achieves strict security and privacy with minimal loss in performance.",

LLMs offer many conveniences to the AI engineer, and the most important benefit is their robustness in handling semantic matches of user queries. In other words, an engineer building an AI conversational assistant does not need to train the agent for semantic user query matches explicitly. This benefit comes with a cost, which is felt in two ways. Firstly, LLMs need an expensive infrastructure like GPUs, large RAMs, etc. Secondly, even with all the cutting-edge infrastructure, their response time will not be sub-second anytime soon. So, AI applications that use LLMs are likely to be expensive and suffer from high latency. One way to reduce cost and response time is by introducing a caching solution between the LLMs and the UX layer. Such a caching layer can help minimize calls to LLMs when the queries are similar and repetitive. However, traditional caching methods cannot be used as they are for LLM-based applications. The reason is that queries handled by AI-based conversational assistants are unstructured, i.e., free-flowing user-generated text, and will not always be context-free. In other words, end users tend to query from their point of view. Existing solutions like GPTCache work well for context-free questions, but caching context-sensitive user queries needs an evolved design.

							"abstract": "Domain adaptation (DA) has emerged as a promising approach to address the domain shift problem in deep learning for automated medical diagnosis. However, current approaches often overlook the imbalanced nature of different categories and primarily focus on aligning the distributions of the source and target domains globally. This oversight leads to suboptimal performance on imbalanced target datasets, as the alignment process becomes dominated by the majority class during adaptation. To tackle this limitation, this paper proposes a novel domain adaptation method called cost-sensitive distribution alignment (CSDA), which aims to enhance deep learning performance on target data. The proposed approach involves collecting a limited-sized dataset from the target domain and utilising CSDA to bridge the domain gap between the source and target domains. Specifically, to address class imbalance, cost-sensitive learning is incorporated into the distribution alignment process, giving more emphasis to the misalignment cost associated with minority class samples. More importantly, CSDA aligns the cross-domain projection distribution in the feature space with the ideal geometric distribution derived from the ground-truth labels. Unlike existing methods that directly minimise or employ adversarial learning to reduce the distribution discrepancy between the source and target domains, our proposed CSDA method focuses on minimising the semantic relationship misalignment among cross-domain samples. Experimental results on the detection of high myopia and myopic macular degeneration (MMD) demonstrate the superiority of CSDA over state-of-the-art methods.

							"abstract": "In this paper, we address the challenge of developing advanced motor control systems for modern washing machines, which are required to operate under various conditions. Traditional system designs often rely on manual trial-and-error methods, limiting the potential for performance enhancement. To overcome this, we propose a novel continual offline reinforcement learning framework, specifically tailored to improve balance maintenance during the dehydration cycle of washing machines. Our approach introduces a delayed online update mechanism that leverages accumulated transition data from certain periods of online interaction. This method effectively circumvents the distribution shift problem commonly encountered in offline reinforcement learning. Our empirical results demonstrate a substantial improvement, with an average increase of nearly 16% in load balancing efficiency across various tasks, including those involving different types of laundry.

The current industry standard allows for efficient validation of the content of display texts and graphics. However, validating layout information such as the relative positions, alignments, sizes and types of each visual asset on the screen remains a difficult task, as the differences between layouts are not homogeneous. At first glance, some user interfaces may appear to be rather similar but in fact fall under different layouts, due to slight variances in the region or activation conditions. In this work, we propose a two-stage deep learning based framework for efficient layout recognition, which can be applied in general HMI user interface validation tasks. First, we train an object detection model to produce bounding boxes around visual assets within the specified region of interest in the pre-processed input images, along with the object class label. Next, we match the extracted structural information of the test image against the ground truth reference layout designs via two different strategies: a self-supervised learning method (BYOL) and a custom IoU-based layout matching algorithm. While the IoU-based method slightly outperforms BYOL in terms of accuracy, BYOL boasts faster inference speed and can be generalized easily to unseen input images and layouts.

DenseNet201 architecture has alleviated the issue of gradient vanishing by utilizing dense connections. This study aims to detect brain stroke conditions by developing two deep learning models utilizing the transfer learning architecture of DenseNet201. Two deep learning models serve as a two-step process to identify ischemic stroke and its subtype conditions. Model 01 achieved an intrinsic accuracy of 97. 03% in the training set, 94. 50% in the validation set. Also, test and test time augmentation accuracy (TTA) was 94.50%. Model 02 reached an intrinsic accuracy of 98.02% in the training set and 95.67% in the validation set. Further, the test and TTA accuracy were 95.67%.",

							"abstract": "Deploying machine learning in open environments presents the challenge of encountering diverse test inputs that differ significantly from the training data. These out-of-distribution samples may exhibit shifts in local or global features compared to the training distribution. The machine learning (ML) community has responded with a number of methods aimed at distinguishing anomalous inputs from original training data. However, the majority of previous studies have primarily focused on the output layer or penultimate layer of pre-trained deep neural networks. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Multitesting-based Layer-wise Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Detection (MLOD), to identify distributional shifts in test samples at different levels of features through rigorous multiple testing procedure. Our approach distinguishes itself from existing methods as it does not require modifying the structure or fine-tuning of the pre-trained classifier. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed framework can seamlessly integrate with any existing distance-based inspection method while efficiently utilizing feature extractors of varying depths. Our scheme effectively enhances the performance of out-of-distribution detection when compared to baseline methods. In particular, MLOD-Fisher achieves superior performance in general. When trained using KNN on CIFAR10, MLOD-Fisher significantly lowers the false positive rate (FPR) from 24.09% to 7.47% on average compared to merely utilizing the features of the last layer.",

Manual lesion segmentation based on automated methods face significant challenges in clinical integration due to MRI domain shifts, i.e. discrepancies between training and deployment data, notably due to different acquisition settings. We apply TTT to each patient individually, offering an effective strategy to mitigate domain shift without the need of additional annotated data or data from other patients.

While justification of key design choices are often neglected in the literature, we explore the viability of TTT in a real-case scenario and conduct an extensive evaluation of key hyperparameters in TTT, including the choice and the placement of the auxiliary task, the type of normalization layer, and the model parameters to adapt. We carry out this study in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) diagnosis relying on focal lesions visible in conventional MRI. Manual lesion segmentation based on automated methods face significant challenges in clinical integration due to MRI domain shifts, i.e. discrepancies between training and deployment data, notably due to different acquisition settings. We apply TTT to each patient individually, offering an effective strategy to mitigate domain shift without the need of additional annotated data or data from other patients. We ground our experiments on real-world distribution shifts using three distinct MS datasets. Finally, we propose general guidelines to apply TTT in practice.

							"abstract": "The increasing global burden of infectious and parasitic diseases (IPDs) presents a significant challenge to public health systems worldwide, particularly to emergency departments (EDs). Accurate forecasting of ED attendances for IPDs is crucial for effective resource planning and public health interventions. We present a novel method for forecasting nationwide IPDs ED attendances incorporating a high-dimensional set of disease and environmental covariates. National ED attendances with IPDs as a cause in Singapore from 2009 to 2018 was taken as the study setting. We proposed simple and trimmed pooling of forecasts using 6 models which can optimize point forecast accuracy over a 1 to 8-week forecast horizon. We found that forecast combinations based on trimmed means provided superior forecast accuracy over sub-models which were used to construct the forecast combinations. Forecast combinations consistently achieved a Mean Absolute Percentage Error below 10.5% in the forecast horizon of 1\u20138 weeks ahead over the study period. We further demonstrated the robustness of forecast combinations in maintaining good forecast performance even when some sub-model constituents performed significantly worse compared to alternatives. Moreover, epidemiological analysis that employed post-selection inference revealed significant correlations between decreases in past temperature and increases in total precipitation, PM2.5 surface concentration with increased ED attendances for IPDs.

Accurate forecasting of ED attendances for IPDs is crucial for effective resource planning and public health interventions. We present a novel method for forecasting nationwide IPDs ED attendances incorporating a high-dimensional set of disease and environmental covariates. National ED attendances with IPDs as a cause in Singapore from 2009 to 2018 was taken as the study setting. We proposed simple and trimmed pooling of forecasts using 6 models which can optimize point forecast accuracy over a 1 to 8-week forecast horizon. We found that forecast combinations based on trimmed means provided superior forecast accuracy over sub-models which were used to construct the forecast combinations. Forecast combinations consistently achieved a Mean Absolute Percentage Error below 10.5% in the forecast horizon of 1\u20138 weeks ahead over the study period. We further demonstrated the robustness of forecast combinations in maintaining good forecast performance even when some sub-model constituents performed significantly worse compared to alternatives. Moreover, epidemiological analysis that employed post-selection inference revealed significant correlations between decreases in past temperature and increases in total precipitation, PM2.5 surface concentration with increased ED attendances for IPDs. The proposed methods can provide forward guidance for potential outbreaks and refine short to long\u2013term resource management for ED admissions.

							"abstract": "With the development of information technology, solving large-scale optimization problems (LSOPs) has become an urgent issue in the artificial intelligence (AI) for solving practical problems. LSOPs are optimization problems with high dimensions and large search space. Although many improved evolutionary computation (EC) algorithms have been proposed as promising AI approaches for dealing with LSOPs, they still face two challenges, which are easily falling into local optima and having slow convergence speed. Focusing on these two challenges, this paper proposes to integrate the gene targeting (GT) technology in the biotechnology with the particle swarm optimization (PSO), so as to propose a gene targeting particle swarm optimization (GTPSO) algorithm. The GTPSO works well in solving LSOPs due to the following three novel designs. Firstly, a Monte Carlo probabilistically targeting strategy is used to determine the poorly-performing dimension(s) of the globally best particle, so as to balance the targeting chance of all the dimensions. Secondly, a dual GT (DGT) strategy is proposed, including two GT strategies called GT1 and GT2, to modify the poorly-performing dimension(s), which can balance diversity and convergence at the same time. Thirdly, a greedy strategy is used to accept the targeted new solution only if it is better than the original globally best particle, so as to ensure the quality of the evolution. In the experiment, the GTPSO algorithm is evaluated on 12 benchmark functions and obtains excellent results, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the GT strategy and the GTPSO algorithm.",

In GC-LDP, we introduce two items, the average of the personal best positions and the average of the personal current positions, into the velocity update formula of traditional Particle Swarm Optimization to utilize the group knowledge to correct the exploitation direction. In addition, a local disturbance strategy is designed in GC-LDP to increase the swarm diversity by searching the nearest particle group in the solution space to enhance the algorithm's exploration ability. GC-LDP has been theoretically proven to be an anytime algorithm. Furthermore, based on the extensive experiments on four types of benchmark problems, we demonstrate that GC-LDP outperforms state-of-the-art C-DCOP algorithms in terms of convergence speed and solution quality.",

							"abstract": "New technologies are destined to disrupt, but artificial intelligence (AI) has achieved unusual cultural impact, inspiring visceral fear in some, yet rapidly proliferating through pervasive adoption. But by its nature, adoption of AI necessitates more than mere acceptance: it requires trust. Trust surpasses cooperation; cooperation elicits predictability, but cannot enable the vulnerability described by human trust theorist Niklas Luhmann. The bond of trust must be developed through interaction, and humans inherit social constructs and societal norms that regulate verbal and behavioral communication, indicating internal state. AI must learn to read these cues to engender trust and recover when its human partner becomes distrustful. Our experimental platform, Hapti Bird, creates an environment for testing scenarios and observing interactions from which to better understand how humans trust each other, and how they trust AI. For this paper, we performed a variation of the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma with haptic devices and sensory capture involving two human subjects in an embodied joint action paradigm, taking the form of a video game. From video-derived heartrate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) we predict in-game cooperativity between subjects up to 7 seconds into the future (71% F1 score). Facial expressions tell of significantly different experiences of subjects depending on the amount of time given to establish trust, and when that trust is broken. Our accumulated findings educated an AI, named Hapti Bot, to embody the formulation of trust between humans. Hapti Bot was trained using genetic algorithms, which continuously generated AI candidates within given parameters. This process mimicked biological evolution and produced a Bot optimized to thrive in the Hapti Bird environment.",

For this paper, we performed a variation of the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma with haptic devices and sensory capture involving two human subjects in an embodied joint action paradigm, taking the form of a video game. From video-derived heartrate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) we predict in-game cooperativity between subjects up to 7 seconds into the future (71% F1 score). Facial expressions tell of significantly different experiences of subjects depending on the amount of time given to establish trust, and when that trust is broken. Our accumulated findings educated an AI, named Hapti Bot, to embody the formulation of trust between humans. Hapti Bot was trained using genetic algorithms, which continuously generated AI candidates within given parameters. This process mimicked biological evolution and produced a Bot optimized to thrive in the Hapti Bird environment.",

							"abstract": "Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease. No dominating clinical feature determines how physicians make clinical decisions for patients with CAD. CAD clinical features are wide ranging, from symptoms, to risk factors, to kidney disease, to individualized factors such as family history. These diverse features are weighted differently by each physician in their evaluation of the patient, leading to variable clinical decision pathways. The aim of this study is to utilize a deep learning framework with a sequential attention mechanism that amassed CAD clinical features, to determine key features that dominated the final clinical decision. We identified a total of 10 variables inclusive of 7 cardiovascular risk factors, 2 symptoms as well as any previous cardiac testing done that would affect the clinical decision making for management of CAD, producing a total of 13,824 total scenarios. Subsequently, we focused on cardiovascular risk factors, selecting a total of 6 features, to produce a total of 384 scenarios for the parent dataset. A total of 3 decisions outcomes representing therapeutic decision making were chosen: 'Risk factor management alone', 'exercise ECG' as well as 'functional or anatomical testing'. Features such as Diabetes Mellitus (approx. 0.083), Peripheral Vascular Disease/Cerebrovascular Accident/Family History (approx. 0.061) and Framingham Risk score Ten Year Risk (approx. 0.053) ranked high in importance in the SHAP analysis with the model attaining a good overall accuracy of 0.966. Feature optimization using only these top three features showed good model accuracy of 0.922.

Koh National Heart Centre Singapore, Singapore angela.koh.s.m@singhealth.com.sg artificial intelligence coronary artery disease clinical decision-making deep learning neural networks Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease. No dominating clinical feature determines how physicians make clinical decisions for patients with CAD. CAD clinical features are wide ranging, from symptoms, to risk factors, to kidney disease, to individualized factors such as family history. These diverse features are weighted differently by each physician in their evaluation of the patient, leading to variable clinical decision pathways. The aim of this study is to utilize a deep learning framework with a sequential attention mechanism that amassed CAD clinical features, to determine key features that dominated the final clinical decision. We identified a total of 10 variables inclusive of 7 cardiovascular risk factors, 2 symptoms as well as any previous cardiac testing done that would affect the clinical decision making for management of CAD, producing a total of 13,824 total scenarios. Subsequently, we focused on cardiovascular risk factors, selecting a total of 6 features, to produce a total of 384 scenarios for the parent dataset. A total of 3 decisions outcomes representing therapeutic decision making were chosen: 'Risk factor management alone', 'exercise ECG' as well as 'functional or anatomical testing'. Features such as Diabetes Mellitus (approx. 0.083), Peripheral Vascular Disease/Cerebrovascular Accident/Family History (approx. 0.061) and Framingham Risk score Ten Year Risk (approx. 0.053) ranked high in importance in the SHAP analysis with the model attaining a good overall accuracy of 0.966. Feature optimization using only these top three features showed good model accuracy of 0.922. On the other hand, the TabNet architecture reported high feature importance for Framingham Risk score Ten Year Risk (0.298), followed by chronic kidney disease (0.297) and Family history of premature death (0.235) which contributed to a best test accuracy of 0.940 out of 10 epochs.

Earlier research has focused on specific weather variables and algorithms, there is a significant demand for models incorporating a wide range of variables and algorithms for superior performance. This study aims to predict transmission rates of dengue at the ward level in National Capital Territory (NCT) Delhi, India using different ML models. Data regarding incidence of dengue along with population and meteorological data as predictors during the period 2015-2022 have been used. The incidence data of dengue and population data have been collected from the Municipal Corporation Delhi (MCD) and Census of India, respectively. Meteorological data consisting of 20 parameters has been downloaded from NASA POWER. Five ML algorithms, including an ensemble approach, have been trained and validated. Comparative assessments using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) with the Area Under the Curve (AUC), accuracy, and F1 score have been carried out. It has been found that the accuracy of ensemble ML methods, such as Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest outperformed other models, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine. A correlation coefficient (r) of 0.40 has been used to evaluate the influence of meteorological variables on dengue transmission. Variables that exceed this threshold are considered to make a significant contribution to the transmission of dengue. Variable importance analysis shows significant contribution of Surface Soil Wetness (r= 0.48), Relative Humidity at 2 Meters (r= 0.45), Precipitation (r= 0.42), Wind Direction at 2 Meters (r= -0.54), Wind Direction at 10 Meters (r= -0.53), Temperature at 2 Meters (r= -0.47), and Earth Skin Temperature (r= -0.46).

Variable importance analysis shows significant contribution of Surface Soil Wetness (r= 0.48), Relative Humidity at 2 Meters (r= 0.45), Precipitation (r= 0.42), Wind Direction at 2 Meters (r= -0.54), Wind Direction at 10 Meters (r= -0.53), Temperature at 2 Meters (r= -0.47), and Earth Skin Temperature (r= -0.46). This study provides an excellent basis for future research, notably on dengue transmission modeling in dense urban environments and early warning systems using predictive models. This study provides insight on how ML algorithms may forecast dengue transmission rates and emphasizes the need to examine a variety of variables for model success.",

							"abstract": "Studies show that artificial intelligence (AI) with embedded physics solvers has improved the accuracy of predictions on various physics problems, especially those associated with fluid dynamics. The crucial element in optimizing weight training for estimating flow fields within the AI network lies in the choice of the loss function. In addressing regression-type problems, particularly those involving the temporal evolution of flow fields, the mean square error (MSE) loss function is commonly employed at the current and single time step. However, an issue arises in existing methodologies that utilize MSE-based loss functions with single-time step information for predicting unsteady flow. Most of these approaches overlook the significance of incorporating the temporal history of the flow, a factor that cannot be disregarded in the context of numerical solvers. Hence, in this work, a physics-based AI (PbAI) method with higher-order loss functions is applied to unsteady scenarios, in particular to two distinct turbulent flows where a multitude of fine structures is present, namely, forced and decaying turbulence. Direct numerical simulations on uniform Cartesian grids are conducted to simulate these scenarios, generating two distinct datasets for training and inference. Each dataset comprises 32 randomly initialized conditions spanning 4,848 time steps for each turbulent flow type. Five distinct models are devised, incorporating features such as rollouts from coarse numerical solvers and temporal considerations in the loss function calculation. The constructed PbAI models demonstrate consistent improvements in predictive performance over the entire temporal domain. These findings are further corroborated through vorticity correlation analyses. The empirical result demonstrates that the accuracy of the baseline case improves by up to 48% and 30% for forced and decaying turbulence, respectively.

We frame this work in the context of histopathology image classification, where labelling is prohibitively expensive. To this end, we introduce an active few shot learning framework, Myriad Active Learning (MAL), including a contrastive-learning encoder, pseudo-label generation, and novel query sample selection in the loop. Specifically, we propose to massage unlabelled data in a self-supervised manner, where the obtained data representations and clustering knowledge form the basis to activate the AL loop.

To ensure a safe system operation, it is imperative to understand the extent of these challenges and identify specific vulnerabilities. In this paper, we evaluate the corruption robustness of state-of-the-art real-time object detection models for ASVs. We conduct a comprehensive analysis across various model scales, employing three distinct waterborne object detection datasets. By augmenting each test dataset with 15 types of corruption, we investigate model robustness according to two proposed metrics. Our findings reveal that certain corruption types markedly impair object detection performance, which could pose significant safety risks in autonomous shipping. Conversely, some corruption types have minimal effect on performance, regardless of the model or dataset. Furthermore, the results reveal a notable correlation between the scale of object detection model and its robustness, with larger models generally exhibiting higher resilience to corruption.",

We conduct a comprehensive analysis across various model scales, employing three distinct waterborne object detection datasets. By augmenting each test dataset with 15 types of corruption, we investigate model robustness according to two proposed metrics. Our findings reveal that certain corruption types markedly impair object detection performance, which could pose significant safety risks in autonomous shipping. Conversely, some corruption types have minimal effect on performance, regardless of the model or dataset. Furthermore, the results reveal a notable correlation between the scale of object detection model and its robustness, with larger models generally exhibiting higher resilience to corruption.",

To tackle these challenges, we propose a new framework termed Abstention-Aware Federated Voting (AAFV) that can collaboratively and confidentially train heterogeneous local models while simultaneously protecting the data privacy. This is achieved by integrating a novel abstention-aware voting mechanism and a differential privacy mechanism onto local models' predictions.

This task provides a convenient use case for Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which have demonstrated impressive pixel-wise reconstruction metrics in microscope image super-resolution tasks. However, the benchmarks which report these metrics typically do so on low-resolution images generated through simple synthetic degradations, which fail to recreate the natural distortions imparted by experimental image acquisition. Because most reported synthetic data generation pipelines rely on the bicubic downsampling of a few high-resolution images, networks trained to correct for this distortion eventually fail downstream when required to super-resolve images containing natural distortions. The literature therefore provides us with an unreliable assessment of GANs' ability to super-resolve microscope imagery in the field. In this work, we present one of the few examples of GANs successfully super-resolving a large cache of experimentally gathered microscope imagery. For our main result, we demonstrate a reliable baseline for the super-resolution task using GAN, in which we obtain a peak-signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 29.21 and a structural similarity index (SSIM) of 0.845 by using all available image pairs and averaging across all sub-datasets. To demonstrate robustness on this task, we present the model with a blind super-resolution task, in which it achieves a PSNR of 25.75 and SSIM of 0.676 after averaging across all sub-datasets. To affirm our results as a reliable baseline, we demonstrate that GANs can fail in the video-rate super-resolution task even when trained on higher-order synthetic degradation pipelines. We confirm this effect by training our model on purely synthetic data, using the pipeline mentioned above, and testing it on a single sub-dataset. In doing so, we observe a -0.06 loss in SSIM and -0.75 loss in PSNR, accompanied by significant quality degradation of the reconstructed images in the form of severe distortion and artifact generation.",

							"abstract": "The concentration and chemical composition of airborne aerosol particles are important indicators of air quality and sources of air pollution. The particles' chemical composition reveals probable emission sources, like traffic, biomass burning, wildfires, agriculture, or industrial sources. Single-particle mass spectrometry (SPMS), combined with rapid spectral classification, uniquely enables an in-situ analysis of the chemical composition of individual aerosol particles in real-time for environmental monitoring and other tasks. Modern SPMS devices analyze hundreds of individual particles per minute. Rapid and accurate classification of such large amounts of data remains challenging. Conventional clustering algorithms require tedious manual post-processing. A mass spectrum can be understood as a 1D image per analyzed particle. We applied CNN-based algorithms to perform a fully automated classification. To train the models, usually a large amount of labeled data needs to be prepared. With a manually created benchmark dataset containing 10,400 samples in 13 classes of emission sources (800 samples per class) we achieved an accuracy of ~90%. If the models are trained using only 100 labeled samples per class (1/8 labeled data), the models' accuracy drops significantly to ~75%. We explored suitable augmentation methods to improve the reliability and performance of multi-class classification for aerosol particle mass spectra in case of limited labeled data (1/8 labeled data). The results using the augmented data improved from ~75% to 86.8%. This paves the way to sharply reduce the expensive and time-consuming work of expert labeling. Furthermore, we verified that converting the 1D mass spectrum into 2D representations and classifying them using 2D-CNN is more efficient than 1D-CNN networks, whether with or without data augmentation.",

Moreover, the continuous increase in air traffic demand requires approaches that can work well in new scenarios. While heuristics rely on a fixed set of rules, which limits the ability to explore new solutions, Reinforcement Learning offers a versatile framework to automate the search and generalize to unseen scenarios. Finding a suitable state observation and reward structure design is essential in using Reinforcement Learning. In this paper, we investigate the impact of providing the Reinforcement Learning agent with an intermediate positive signal in the reward structure along with the use of the Full State Observation and the Local State Observation. We perform training with different combinations of the reward structure, the state observation, and the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm to define the training efficient formulation. We use two types of scenarios, medium and high-density, to test the ability to generalize to unseen data of the approach. Each type of scenario is used to train two separate models, Model 1 and Model 2. Model 1, which is trained on high-density scenarios, will be tested with medium-density scenarios; the results obtained will then be compared with the results of Model 2, and vice versa.

Results suggest that combining the Local State Observation and the intermediate positive signal leads to a stable convergence.

To address this issue, the hierarchically structured meta-learning (HSML) has been proposed in the literature. The HSML utilizes a hierarchically structured cluster to address task relationship and similarity, which is regarded as transferable knowledge.

Meanwhile, the ImageNet pre-trained image encoder is still a mature choice of backbone for the semantic segmentation task, especially when the SAM is category-irrelevant. As a result, our SSR provides a simple yet highly effective design. It uses the ImageNet pre-trained image encoder as the backbone, and the intermediate feature of each stage (i.e. there are 4 stages in MiT-B5) is regularized by SAM during training.

The main strength of SR is in discovering new equations which are explainable and interpretable, in contrast to many black-box machine learning models. Thus, SR has become a first-class algorithm in various fields, including physics and engineering, and more recently healthcare. In this paper, we utilize and evaluate recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) SR methods and introduce our new proposed SR methods to the problem of estimating Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR). GFR is a key indicator of kidney health and is an important determinant in certain diagnoses, such as Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). As measuring GFR directly is expensive, the common practice for healthcare professionals is to use medical equations to estimate GFR from other biomarkers. However, most of these equations are built on specific populations and are potentially inaccurate for other populations. Additionally, there has been a growing need to tailor equations for cohorts with unique properties (e.g., young children, renal transplant patients). To address these issues, we propose to use SR to discover new equations to better estimate GFR for new populations or new cohorts. First, we utilize SOTA SR methods to discover equations that achieve better estimation performance than existing equations. Then, we introduce our novel method of taking existing GFR medical estimation equations as prior knowledge and evolving them via Constrained Genetic Perturbation (CGP). The prior knowledge used drastically reduces the search space and also discovers equations that closely resemble the functional forms familiar to medical professionals.

Existing audio-visual models that can control facial features require encoders that encode driving videos, which is both computationally expensive and limited by the availability of such driving videos. In this paper, we address this limitation and aim to control facial features without encoding driving videos. We propose a cascaded GAN-based audio-visual model, which incorporates face mesh as an intermediate representation. Different from existing cascaded methods that use facial landmarks, our method uses face mesh as a medium of informative facial feature representation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first cascaded model that allows controllable talking face generation via face mesh. We train our audio-visual model with training samples of MEAD dataset. In the evaluation, we benchmark our model in extensive experiments on MEAD and LRW datasets.

PVPNN has the potential to transform design discovery by enabling researchers and engineers to specify design requirements seamlessly via prompts, analyze available large-scale relevant historical data sets to generate novel physics-conform designs and predict the efficacy of potential design candidates rapidly. Starting from a given image or prompt for an ideal design as the baseline, our proposed framework first generates potential designs from a vision foundation model.

PVPNN has the potential to transform design discovery by enabling researchers and engineers to specify design requirements seamlessly via prompts, analyze available large-scale relevant historical data sets to generate novel physics-conform designs and predict the efficacy of potential design candidates rapidly. Starting from a given image or prompt for an ideal design as the baseline, our proposed framework first generates potential designs from a vision foundation model. Based on the practicality requirements provided by the user through text prompt, the PVPNN initializes a resource-efficient physics-informed neural network and jointly optimizes both geometry and physics models in an end-to-end mode.

This study divides the entire process into three steps: object detection, key point prediction, and pose estimation. We have leveraged You Only Look Once (YOLOv8) to detect and predict the key points of the stainless steel buckles. The study has successfully tackled a significant challenge in machine vision, namely detecting the shiny metal parts of the buckle against a similarly shiny background. Furthermore, we validated the effectiveness of our computer vision approach by adopting a training approach that combines real and synthetic data, which mitigates overfitting issues during neural network training.",

This can largely be credited to the sense of synesthesia, or the combining of senses. Based on this concept of synesthesia, we want to explore whether generative AI can create visual representations for music. The aim is to inspire the user's imagination and enhance the user experience when enjoying music. Our approach has the following steps: (a) Music is analyzed and classified into multiple dimensions (including instruments, emotion, tempo, pitch range, harmony, and dynamics) to produce textual descriptions. (b) The texts form inputs of machine models that can predict the genre of the input audio. (c) The prompts are inputs of generative machine models to create visual representations. The visual representations are continuously updated as the music plays, ensuring that the visual effects aptly mirror the musical changes. A comprehensive user study with 88 users confirms that our approach is able to generate visual art reflecting the music pieces. From a list of images covering both abstract images and realistic images, users considered that our system-generated images can better represent pieces of music than human-chosen images. It suggests that generative arts can become a promising method to enhance users' listening experience while enjoying music. In addition to showing videos of performers, our approach provides a new approach to let audiences passively understand and enjoy the music through generative arts.",

Existing studies rely on building recommendation models from large-scale users' check-in data, which is task-specific and needs extensive computational resources.

However, the generalization abilities of LLMs still are unexplored to address the next POI recommendations, where users' geographical movement patterns should be extracted. Although there are studies that leverage LLMs for next-item recommendations, they fail to consider the geographical influence and sequential transitions. Hence, they cannot effectively solve the next POI recommendation task. To this end, we design novel prompting strategies and conduct empirical studies to assess the capability of LLMs, e.g., ChatGPT, for predicting a user's next check-in. Specifically, we consider several essential factors in human movement behaviors, including user geographical preference, spatial distance, and sequential transitions, and formulate the recommendation task as a ranking problem. Through extensive experiments on two widely used real-world datasets, we derive several key findings. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that LLMs have promising zero-shot recommendation abilities and can provide accurate and reasonable predictions.

To overcome these challenges, we propose a synthetic dataset featuring virtual humans in microgravity, serving as a cost-effective alternative for training pose estimation models. Our methodology employs transfer learning with an HRNET backbone and associative embedding, facilitating the retraining of models for 2D human pose estimation on established datasets like COCO and MMPose. Evaluation against publicly available images of astronauts in the International Space Station (ISS) demonstrates our model's robust generalization, with the best result showing a 20% improvement compared to models trained with COCO dataset. This research demonstrates the viability of synthetic datasets for training models in unique environments. The proposed methodology showcases improved model performance in microgravity scenarios, marking a stride in advancing human pose estimation for space exploration.",
